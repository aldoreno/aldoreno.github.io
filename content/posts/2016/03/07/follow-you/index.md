Vocalist Oli Sykes shared in a track-by-track commentary with Spotify that he and Jordan Fish wrote “Follow You” while they were writing “Drown”. He also shared:

> And when it got to that certain point like “this fucking sucks and I don’t really want to do this anymore,” that’s when you have that realizations. I realized no matter how bad being together can sometimes get, the alternative is so much worse.

Lyrically, it comes from me and my other half were going through a particular rough patch where things weren’t looking too good and it gets to a certain point. And when it got to that certain point like “this fucking sucks and I don’t really want to do this anymore,” that’s when you have that realizations. I realized no matter how bad being together can sometimes get, the alternative is so much worse. It’s one of those beautiful realizations that can only come from something really ugly.
